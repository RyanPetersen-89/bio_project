                My name is Ryan Petersen, I am 34 years old, and I am in the process of a career change. For the
                last few years I have been a home inspector driving all over the state for inspections. Most
                recently I am a Quality Inspector for a company called Connect-Homes that worked on modular
                home builds, but I recently found out that the company is relocating out of state. With that news
                I made the decision to pursue <em>Fullstack Development</em> which has been something that I've been
                interested in for years now. I am very excited for this course and look forward to
                growing as an individual, as well as expanding my skillset into a career that I find fullfilling.
